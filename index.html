			</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://podiumskate.com/">Podium</a> is breaking ground in the skateboarding scene, providing a way for skaters around the world to compete against each other and earn points that could get them invited to national competitions.
				At its core, skaters upload their clips and enter them into competitions, which are scored by the community. Finalists are then judged by a panel of pro skaters.
			</p>
			<p>
				I built the Rails API that serves the iOS and Android apps, a basic admin and judging area, and was the lead developer for the Ionic 2 based iOS and Android apps.
				Check it out on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.podiumskate.podiumskate">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podium-skate-app/id1224152462?mt=8">App Store</a>.

			</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://roottulsa.com/">Root Tulsa</a> is an interconnected geolocation CMS that serves as a guide to life in Tulsa for both locals and visitors.
				It's a Rails API backed iOS app, along with a mobile web version built with Ratchet, and of course an admin area to manage content.
