			<p>I build things for the internet including but not limited to: web apps (mostly Rails), mobile web apps, hybrid apps, and APIs. I take pleasure in making sure my code is documented and understandable by myself and others tomorrow, next week, and next year. This year I've been on sabbatical and recently moved to Seattle to find something fresh.</p>
			<p>You can check out some of my work below.</p>

			</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.newmedio.com/">New Medio</a> is where I spent the past six years as the lead developer building custom software for a number of different clients. Some of these projects were internal company tools, such as a purchase order and invoicing system for a wine and spirits broker as well as service ticket tracking and job dispatching applications for an oil and gas company. Other projects were consumer facing, from an event management and registration platform to altogether new ideas like the following two projects.

				<img src="images/podium.png" alt="Podium" height="40px"> Podium Skate
			</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://podiumskate.com/">Podium</a> is breaking ground in the skateboarding scene, providing a way for skaters around the world to compete against each other and earn points that could get them invited to national competitions.
				At its core, skaters upload their clips and enter them into competitions, which are scored by the community. Finalists are then judged by a panel of pro skaters.
			</p>
			<p>
				I designed and built the Rails API that serves the iOS and Android apps, the admin and judging areas, set up order submissions via Stripe along with video uploading and encoding through AWS, and was the lead developer for the Ionic 2 based iOS and Android apps.

				<img src="images/root.png" alt="Root" height="35px"> Root Tulsa
			</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://roottulsa.com/">Root Tulsa</a> is an interconnected geolocation CMS that serves as a guide to life in Tulsa for both locals and visitors featuring places and events nearby.
				It started as a native iOS app backed by a Rails API along with a mobile web frontend, and of course a content manager.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was the lead architect and developer for the API backend, mobile web app, and admin CMS. However, like most software, this project has been constantly evolving and the frontend you currently interact with was not developed by me.

				<img src="images/wv.png" alt="Welcome Volcano" height="30px"> Welcome Volcano
			</h3>
			<p>
				My interests do not lie solely within the realm of logic and computers. I believe design and a sense of awareness + intent is essential to practically every aspect of life. As such, there are many avenues I pursue to convey the stories of beauty surrounding us so that we might be drawn toward unity and encouraged to seek goodness.
			</p>
			<p>
				Welcome Volcano is the name I've given to this ideology. It's my ikigai and true north&mdash;something to keep me focused and remind me when I've strayed from the path. Whether I write on <a href="https://medium.com/@brianlittmann">Medium</a>, post on <a href="https://instagram.com/tidyhippie">Instagram</a>, or upload on <a href="https://vimeo.com/brianlittmann">Vimeo</a>, the reward I seek is the act of creating itself.
