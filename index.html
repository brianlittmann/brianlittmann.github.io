			<h1>I have a crush on Basecamp.</h1>
			<p>When I read about the new Rails position, it kind of felt like being in high school and hearing the girl you have a crush on is now single, except hopefully less awkward. You don't know me yet, but we have a history. We met about five years ago when I landed my first big-boy development job and you were still Classic. Rails 3 had recently been released and I was greener than a fresh stash of bananas at the grocery store. Little did I know what impact those two things would have on me&mdash;not the products in and of themselves, but the ideas behind them. The 37 signals that Rails and Basecamp were built on.</p>
			<p>In doing client work, you get the gamut of scenarios. There's the client, the lone customer with dollar bills making decisions; the dev shop, the black box that cranks out a product; and me, the developer, hiding inside the black box transcribing said decisions into code. By being at the bottom of the funnel, I get to observe how everything flows and measure the effects. I've worked with other frameworks and found myself pining for conventions. I've been asked "What's the cheapest way?" and built just that. I've seen people who couldn't say no and turn a majestic monolith into something more malevolent. But I am thankful for those experiences, because through them things became more obvious. I don't want my black box to be like one of those Rube Goldberg gumball machines that's wonky as hell with a little kid pissed because he got orange instead of red. I want my black box to be like Apple's Mac Pro circa 2006. That machine was sexy.</p>

			<h1>I've built some stuff.</h1>
			<p>I've broken more bones than I've made open source contributions, so the majority of my work is living the private repo life. Most projects were with Rails and PostgreSQL, but I've also built an ecosystem with Django and MySQL. I've built payments with Braintree and Stripe. I've tried to forget Authorize.Net. I've messed with custom maps enough to know they suck if not designed properly. I treat Bootstrap like breakfast and weep every time I have to rummage through AWS docs.</p>
			<p>Without further ado, here are a couple of my recent projects.</p>

			<h3 class="project-header">
				<img src="images/vupit.png" alt="VUPIT" height="30px"> VUPIT BMX
			</h3>
			<p>
				VUPIT BMX is breaking ground in the freestyle BMX scene, providing a way for riders around the world to compete against each other and earn points that could get them invited to national competitions.
				At its core, riders upload their clips and enter them into competitions, which are then scored by the community and finalists are judged by pro BMX riders.
			</p>
			<p>
				I built the Rails API that serves the iOS and Android apps, a basic admin and judging area, and was the lead developer for the Ionic 2 based Android app.
				Check it out on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.freestyle649648">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vupit-bmx/id1087417307?mt=8">App Store</a>.
			</p>

			<h3 class="project-header">
				<img src="images/root.png" alt="Root" height="50px"> Root Tulsa
			</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://roottulsa.com/">Root Tulsa</a> is essentially an interconnected geolocation CMS that serves as a guide to life in Tulsa for both locals and visitors.
				It's another Rails API backed iOS app, along with a mobile web version built with Ratchet, and of course an admin area to manage content.
				I built everything except the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/root-tulsa/id1079581299?mt=8">iOS app</a>.

			<h1>My name is Brian.</h1>
			<p>Through the marriage of good philosophy and a good framework, you've been impossible to ignore. What's truly remarkable though is, since defining that philosophy at the turn of the century, you've stuck to it for over seventeen years. Sure, it's been refined with experience, but one can see through <i>Getting Real</i> in 2006, The Rails Doctrine, and those many blog posts ever since, the essence is still there. You're still lean. You're still focused. You still know how to say no and are still judicious with how you give your fucks&mdash;not putting profits ahead of people, whether team or customers. Your track record proves you care, and that's what I want to be a part of.</p>
